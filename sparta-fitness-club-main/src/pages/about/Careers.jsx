        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Fitness Blender was created by a husband and wife team of personal
          trainers who felt that there was a lack of reliable health and fitness
          information on the web. They were frustrated that too many people in
          the fitness industry were more focused on monetary gain or outward
          appearance than on good, achievable, long-term health. Now, more than
          10 years later, Kelli and Daniel Segars, are still focused on their
          original goals and approach for the company:
        </p>
        <li>
          Make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachableâ€”for
          as many people as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Endorse eating unprocessed, whole foods, and working out for a strong,
          healthy body.
        </li>
        <li>Encourage a personal, mindful approach to eating and exercise.</li>
        <li>
          Promote the fact that overall wellness looks different for each
          individual.
        </li>
